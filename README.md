# Etch-a-Sketch

This project helped me become better at DOM manipulating and handling Javascript events, as well as practicing Flexbox. 

Technologies Utilized: 
- Javascript
- CSS
- HTML 

This mini project created a mini Sketchboard, which has a clean UI, as well as the following features: 
- A button to activate the eraser tool
- A button to activate the reset tool
- A button to activate the draw tool
- A button to activate the rainbow tool
- A button to activate the resize tool (resizes the grid, ex: 64x64)

NOTE: The grid cannot be resized above 100x100
